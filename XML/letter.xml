    <section num="1">Even now that we are out of sight of land, it seems impossible that I am
        actually off to France and, for the first time in my life, traveling alone. Everything has
        happened so quickly since the American Fund for French Wounded found an opening for me in
        Paris that I suppose I am still somewhat dazed &amp; bewildered. The fact that I don&apos;t
        know what it will all be like and that I can&apos;t look ahead makes it easier to be happy
        and live in the present. Of course I have had a bit of a taste in New York of the work that
        the A. F. F. W. is doing but its Headquarters in Paris will be different in some ways I
        fancy.</section>

    <section num="2">I can&apos;t get over how lucky I am to have this chance for I realize how few
        girls of my age are getting across, and I understood the grit and pluck which made you
        encourage me on my great adventure and send me along a path which has proved so dangerous of
        late.</section>

    <section num="3">As we drifted down the river, in the sunset glow with two absurd tugs puffing
        alongside, I know that many eyes were moist and that the same thought was in all our minds.
        How many of this ship&apos;s company will see that sky-line again! It was very quiet, no one
        spoke much, and, little by little, the glow faded from the sky and one star after another
        appeared. I knew that you would be looking at those same stars down in Lakewood and that
        your thoughts &amp; prayers were the same that filled my heart at that moment. Somehow
        distance does not separate, after all. </section>
    <section num="4">We waited near the Statue of Liberty until midnight—a rumor had it that a
        &quot;personage&quot; was to come on board. This individual was shrouded in mystery until we
        put to sea when it was given out that the party which had clambered aboard in the night was
        none other than the Italian Mission. Our spirits rose at once for, what with Frank Sayre on
        the boat and these distinguished Italian gentlemen, we shall doubtless be honored by a
        bigger convoy and so doubly safe. However, thus far we have but two destroyers following us.
        They can be seen distinctly outlined against the horizon, one on each side, and seem to be
        the same somber gray which all ships are affecting in this war. A sailor informed me this
        morning that we weren&apos;t in much danger for the first four or five days but that after
        that I might see some excitement. Here&apos;s hoping!</section>

    <section num="5">I have a small inside cabin and my room-mate is quite a character. She is a
        native of Haiti, voluble and very portly—has four large pieces of baggage in our tiny
        stateroom, wears a costume which resembles a Mother Hubbard and smokes countless thin
        cigarettes that smell like incense! When I appeared, there didn't seem to be much room for
        me but, as she says, luckily I am small, and I was soon tucked into the upper berth with my
        belongings! She really isn&apos;t bad and after looking me over carefully told me that she
        didn&apos;t think we would fight and from that time has beamed upon me! She is going over to
        join her son who has been fighting with the French since the beginning of the war but will
        never go back to the Front now, having lost some fingers off each hand. She is so thankful,
        she says, that he hasn&apos;t lost more than his fingers.</section>
