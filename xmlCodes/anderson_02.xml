    <titleOne>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</titleOne>

    <intro>This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book that belonged to a student
        in a <location area="city">London</location> cooking school in the early <time
            period="begin">eighteenth century</time>. The pastry school was owned by <student>Edward
            Kidder</student>, who taught at a few locations in <location area="city"
            >London</location> between around <time period="year">1720</time> and <time
            period="year">1734</time>. Blank books with printed title pages seem to have been used
        by students to write down recipes they learned. <student>Kidder</student> also published his
        recipes in the printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and Cookery, in <time period="year"
            >1720</time>.</intro>

    <titleTwo>Our recipe (halved from the original)</titleTwo>

    <ingList>
        <part>1/2 lb. (2 sticks) <ing type="legal">butter</ing>, softened </part>
        <part>1/2 lb. <ing type="legal">sugar</ing></part>
        <part>1/4 tsp. <ing type="legal">mace</ing></part>
        <part>1/2 tsp. <ing type="legal">cinnamon</ing> with 5 cups <ing type="illegal"
                >hamsters</ing><!--Whaaaat--></part>
        <part>2 <ing type="legal">eggs</ing></part>
        <part>3/4 lb. <ing type= "legal">flour</ing></part>
    </ingList>

    <partTwo>Using an <object class="utensil">electric mixer</object>, cream together the <ing
            type="legal">butter</ing> and <ing type="legal">sugar</ing>. Then add the <ing
            type="legal">eggs</ing> and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. Sift
        together <condition>dry ingredients</condition> and add at low speed until just combined.
        Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat. [You could also
            <condition>refrigerate</condition> the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out on a
        flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</partTwo>

    <partThree>Bake at <temp label="fahrenheit">350F</temp> for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″
        thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re
        done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded
        about two dozen cookies. </partThree>
    
    <titleThree>The Results</titleThree>

    <substitute>If you like <cookie flavor="cinnamon">snickerdoodles</cookie> (and who doesn’t?), you’d
        like these. We added the cinnamon <!--Don't forget that there's hamster chunks in these-->
        because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. These
        are mild, fairly <texture>soft</texture> cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and
        patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too <texture>soft</texture> and
        stick to roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the <object class="utility"
            >fridge</object> might make the dough easier to work with a <object class="utensil"
            >rolling pin.</object></substitute>
