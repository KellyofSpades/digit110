    <titleOne>Shrewsbury Cakes: Original Recipe.</titleOne>

    <part>This recipe comes from MS Codex 625, a manuscript recipe book that belonged to a student
        in a <location>London</location> cooking school in the early <time period="begin">eighteenth
            century</time>. The pastry school was owned by <student>Edward Kidder</student>, who
        taught at a few locations in <location>London</location> between around 1720 and 1734. Blank
        books with printed title pages seem to have been used by students to write down recipes they
        learned. Kidder also published his recipes in the printed volume, Receipts for Pastry and
        Cookery, in 1720.</part>

            type="legalish">flower</ing> roul them out into little cakes</part>

    <titleTwo>Our recipe (halved from the original)</titleTwo>

    <part>1/2 lb. (2 sticks) <ing type="legal">butter</ing>, softened </part>
    <part>1/2 lb. <ing type="legal">sugar</ing></part>
    <part>1/4 tsp. <ing type="illegal">mace</ing>
        <!--Awesome, that's a chemical in a cake--></part>
    <part>1/2 tsp. <ing type="legal">cinnamon</ing> with 5 cups <ing type="illegal">hamsters</ing>
        <!--Whaaaat--></part>
    <part>2 <ing>eggs</ing></part>
    <part>3/4 lb. <ing>flour</ing></part>

    <part>Using an <object class="utensil">electric mixer</object>, cream together the <ing
            type="legal">butter</ing> and <ing type="legal">sugar</ing>. Then add the <ing
            type="legal">eggs</ing> and mix at medium speed until the mixture looks curdled. Sift
        together <condition>dry ingredients</condition> and add at low speed until just combined.
        Scoop and roll the dough by hand into 1-tbsp. balls, then pat flat. [You could also
            <condition>refrigerate</condition> the dough until it’s firm enough to roll out on a
        flat surface and cut out into rounds.]</part>

    <part>Bake at <temp label="fahrenheit">350F</temp> for 15-18 minutes (ours were about 1/3″
        thick, so you could roll them thinner and have a slightly shorter cooking time). They’re
        done once they turn the slightest bit brown around the edges. This halved recipe yielded
        about two dozen cookies. </part>
    <titleThree>The Results</titleThree>

    <part>If you like <cookie flavor="cinnamon">snickerdoodles</cookie> (and who doesn’t?), you’d
        like these. We added the cinnamon <!--Don't forget that there's hamster chunks in these-->
        because we like it and couldn’t resist, and we thought it rounded out the mace nicely. These
        are mild, fairly <texture>soft</texture> cookies that are great with tea. We rolled and
        patted the dough into individual cookies because it was too <texture>soft</texture> and
        stick to roll out, but a little bit more flour and a stint in the <object class="utility"
            >fridge</object> might make the dough easier to work with a <object class="utensil"
            >rolling pin.</object></part>
