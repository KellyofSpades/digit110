        made <destination location="city">Cork</destination>, where we were (sp. where) becalmed –
        we met there a ship we had seen two days before at a distance, she was an armed vessel of
            <destination location="city">Liverpool</destination>, that had been at <destination
            location="city">Barbados</destination>, and was now returning, she had on board the

        settlement in the <direction>West</direction> Indies, lately taken by the <group

        yet on shore – or it might in some respect afford a beautiful prospect – but they have a
        disagreeable way of decorating their coasts with gibbets (sp. jibbets) here and there – Is
        it not surprising, that a people so enlightened, so humane and so polite should have it so
        arranged, that the first object striking the view of the strangers, who approach their shore
        should be an emblem of the severity of their laws and depravity of some of their people.
            <communication>Telegraphs</communication> were also to be seen on every eminence – this
        is a late invention to communicate intelligence of the approach of an enemy or to give
        orders to the ships of the Navy – they are on a line of

        certain figures are put up which are repeated from one (p.35) to the other without being
        understood by any but those from whom the orders issue and the

        the shore, that all was as yet tranquil, that they had only heard of the threats of <person

        we were at too great a distance to distinctly view it – On the 21st we sailed along the
            <group area="Wales">Welsh</group> Coast and passed <destination location="city"
            >Holyhead</destination> – here is elevated land &amp; lofty mountains, whose tops are
        covered with snow, which although they do not prepossess you with an idea of the fertility
        of the country, yet the natural Majestic grandeur of the asylum of the descendants of
        ancient Britons strikes the mind with veneration at the magnanimity and unfortunate valor of
        their ancestors who preferred breathing the air of freedom on <destination

        subjection on their native fertile plains, and calls a sigh for their hero the gallant

    <para num="4">In the evening a <position>Pilot</position> comes on board and next day we arrive
        safe in dock here, the pleasure we felt on the occasion can not well be imagined by any but

            >Sunday</time> and business lulled at rest, yet sufficient was to be seen to give a
        stranger some conception of the magnitude of the trade carried on at this place – the many
        store houses, the multitude of ships, the inland canals and docks all denote wealth &amp;
        exertion, these last are of two kind wet and dry, the latter are to receive vessels to be
        repaired; the former are for (p.36) ships to unload and load in; they are made by digging
        spaces to such a level as to be of sufficient depth for the vessels that are to enter the
        gates of these docks at which the vessels, and flow of the tide are received, are shut in
        the ebb tide by which means the water is retained that keeps the ships afloat – were it not
        for these constructions the lading and unlading would be performed with great inconvenience
        at this port which is not naturally well calculated, the River being amazing shallow at low
        water, and its entry rendered difficult from a number of sand banks.</para>
