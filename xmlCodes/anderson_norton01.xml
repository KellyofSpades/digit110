    <paraOne>I received particular joy at seeing, within the smell of the land, an Old Yorkshire man
        of foreseer who had left his son a merchant in New York, to breath his last in his native
        land; far from the continued storms we met &amp; feeble situation he was in from sea
        sickness I had been apprehensive we should have lost him on the passage. </paraOne>

    <paraTwo>Coasting the Southwest shore of Ireland on that 18th in the evening we made Cork, where
        we were (sp. where) becalmed – we met there a ship we had seen two days before at a
        distance, she was an armed vessel of Liverpool, that had been at Barbados, and was now
        returning, she had on board the Governor, and suite of a Dutch settlement in the West
        Indies, lately taken by the British troops – There is not much appearance of verdure yet on
        shore – or it might in some respect afford a beautiful prospect – but they have a
        disagreeable way of decorating their coasts with gibbets (sp. jibbets) here and there – Is
        it not surprising, that a people so enlightened, so humane and so polite should have it so
        arranged, that the first object striking the view of the strangers, who approach their shore
        should be an emblem of the severity of their laws and depravity of some of their people.
        Telegraphs were also to be seen on every eminence – this is a late invention to communicate
        intelligence of the approach of an enemy or to give orders to the ships of the Navy – they
        are on a line of communica-tion within distinct view of each other – certain figures are put
        up which are repeated from one (p.35) to the other without being understood by any but those
        from whom the orders issue and the commanders of Posts. We there learnt, by the boats which
        came from the shore, that all was as yet tranquil, that they had only heard of the threats
        of Bonaparte which it was not likely, he would be able to put in execu-tion. </paraTwo>

    <paraThree>After night a fair wind springing up, we made sail, and next morning, we were abreast
        of Wicklow Moun-tains, the land is high and elevated, but we were at too great a distance to
        distinctly view it – On the 21st we sailed along the Welsh Coast and passed Holyhead – here
        is elevated land &amp; lofty mountains, whose tops are covered with snow, which although
        they do not prepossess you with an idea of the fertility of the country, yet the natural
        Majestic grandeur of the asylum of the descendants of ancient Britons strikes the mind with
        veneration at the magnanimity and unfortunate valor of their ancestors who preferred
        breathing the air of freedom on Rocky Mountains, to remaining in subjection on their native
        fertile plains, and calls a sigh for their hero the gallant Caractacus.</paraThree>

    <paraFour>In the evening a Pilot comes on board and next day we arrive safe in dock here, the
        pleasure we felt on the occasion can not well be imagined by any but those, who have made a
        long sea voyage. Altho’ this was Sunday and business lulled at rest, yet sufficient was to
        be seen to give a stranger some conception of the magnitude of the trade carried on at this
        place – the many store houses, the multitude of ships, the inland canals and docks all
        denote wealth &amp; exertion, these last are of two kind wet and dry, the latter are to
        receive vessels to be repaired; the former are for (p.36) ships to unload and load in; they
        are made by digging spaces to such a level as to be of sufficient depth for the vessels that
        are to enter the gates of these docks at which the vessels, and flow of the tide are
        received, are shut in the ebb tide by which means the water is retained that keeps the ships
        afloat – were it not for these constructions the lading and unlading would be performed with
        great inconvenience at this port which is not naturally well calculated, the River being
        amazing shallow at low water, and its entry rendered difficult from a number of sand
        banks.</paraFour>

    <paraFive>But the approximate situation of this place to several manufacturing town renders it
        the great emporium of commerce to the West – It is here that are deposited the stuffs of
        Manchester, the cutlery of Birmingham and the woolen cloths of Yorkshire, as are also the
        produce of the west for which they are bartered – it is considered next to London for
        importance in trade: that of Africa however is a branch that is carried on here to some
        extent and is not honorable to the human spe-cies; for it is a barter of their fellow
        creatures – you must not by this imagine, that the slaves are brought here, no, for none
        would be slaves after they had breathed the British air – they are bought in Africa for
        coarse clothes, arms spirits &amp; taken to the West Indies and sold for the produce of these
        Islands, which is brought to this place &amp; from it taken to different parts of the
        country.</paraFive>
