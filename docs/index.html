        <h1>How This Competition Works...</h1>
        <p><strong>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</strong> is a fighting game released by
                <em>Nintendo</em> on 7 December 2018. It is the latest entry to the <strong>Super
                Smash Bros. series.</strong> When played in a tournament style, teams of 4 face off
            against each other from other colleges to become the <strong>ECAC</strong> Champions in
            their division.</p>
        <h1>Match Positions</h1>
        <ol>
            <li>Leading</li>
            <li>Second</li>
            <li>Third</li>
            <li>Anchor</li>
        </ol>
        <p>The <strong>"Leading"</strong> position is the first person up in the competition. The
            have one of the most difficult positions on the team, as they are the ones to see the
            other team's lead as well. The other team is a complete mystery of who they send out as
            their fighter, is it going to be a character you have an advantage on? A disadvantage?
            Are they playing a lightweight or heavyweight? The lead position is completely blind
            going into the match.</p>
        <p>The <strong>"Second"</strong> position is the second person up in the competition. This
            position is much easier to work with knowing how your teammates play, if you have an
            opponent who is good, send in someone who you know would be able to handle them. The
            second position knows what they are dealing with, so it's typical to choose a teammate
            and stage that would hinder the opponent.</p>
        <p>The <strong>"Third"</strong> position is essentially the same as the second position, but
            this position is usually for the stronger members of the team. The team is getting close
            to being out of members, so putting the more troubling opponents for last is better to
            make a comeback or secure a win.</p>
        <p>The <strong>"Anchor"</strong> position is the final person up in the competition.
            Everything rides on this person to either finish off the other team's anchor, or do the
            best they can to not end up with a lose. The anchor is typically the captain of the team
            as they are the best member on their team.</p>
        <h1>Initiating A Match</h1>
        <a href="https://ecac.gg/">ECAC</a>
        <p>Using the <strong>ECAC</strong> website, you should be assigned a competition from your
            college with your division and matches. To see your matches, go to the
                <em>"Competitions"</em> tab on the left-hand side and click on it. Looking at the
            tabs on the page, click on <em>"My Competitions"</em>, clicking on it should show you
            the division you are in, click on that. You should now see the whole roster of every
            college and division listed for the game you are in. To make it more focused on your
            match, clikc on the tab at the top <em>"Matches"</em>. From there, you will see your
            matches, the time, and your opponent. To actually be competing, click on the upcoming
            match. A check in button will be on the top right corner, <strong><em>YOU MUST CHECK IN
                    15 MINUTES BEFORE YOUR MATCH, FAILURE TO DO SO WILL GIVE YOU 15 MINUTES TO SHOW
                    UP OR IT'S AN AUTOMATIC FORFEIT!</em></strong> The <em>captain</em> of each team
            will be the ones who communicate with the other team. Though it's not required, the
                <em>captains</em> can tell the opponents who going to be playing to give the other
            team a clue on what is happening. </p>
