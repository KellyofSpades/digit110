        <h2>Rounds Played- 1 of 8</h2>
        <h2>Stocks Taken- 1</h2>
        <p><strong>Mr. Game and Watch</strong> is <em>Kelly's</em> best main. She used him for
            previous competitions and is known across the whole team for having the best luck with
                <strong>Mr. Game and Watch.</strong>
            <strong>Mr. Game and Watch</strong> is also <em>Kelly's</em> longest used main, with 3
            years of playtime. A move exclusive to <strong>Mr. Game and Watch</strong> that makes
            him a character to be cautious around is his <em>Side Special</em> move, <em>Judge.</em>
            When used, the game pulls a random number from 1-9 and the number <strong>Mr. Game and
                Watch</strong> lands can never be the same back to back. The number ranges in damage
            to where 1 does damage to yourself and 9 is so strong it is almsot always an instant
            K.O.</p>
        <h2>Mario</h2>
        <figure>
            <img src="images/Mario.webp" alt="Mario">

        <h2>Tier- A+</h2>
        <h2>Rounds Played- 7 of 8</h2>
        <h2>Stocks Taken- 12</h2>
        <p><strong>Mario</strong> is <em>Kelly's</em> newest main with only 5 months of playtime.
                <strong>Mario</strong> is best known for his <em>strong aerials</em> and
                <em>combos</em> that are annoying to deal with and pull off to those experienced.
                <strong>Mario's</strong> ladder combo makes it so he can take opponents to the top
            of the map using just <em>Up Air</em>, and when high enough, <strong>Mario's</strong>
            <em>Up Special</em> takes out the opponent and not himself.</p>
        <h2>Banjo and Kazooie</h2>
        <figure>

        <h2>Tier- C+</h2>
        <h2>Rounds Played- 0 of 8</h2>
        <h2>Stocks Taken- 0</h2>
        <p><strong>Banjo and Kazooie</strong> is <em>Kelly's</em> secondary character, she'll pick
                <strong>Mr. Game and Watch</strong> and <strong>Mario</strong> before <strong>Banjo
                and Kazooie,</strong> but has enough experience to run him through competitions.
                <strong>Banjo and Kazooie</strong> are <em>Kelly's</em> second most played character with 8
            months of playtime. Unlike other <em>DLC characters</em>, <strong>Banjo and
                Kazooie</strong> have only one thing that gives them what is known as <em>DLC
                Privilege,</em> which is his <em>Side Special, Wonder Wing.</em> Using this move
            grants <strong>Banjo and Kazooie</strong> temporary invincibility while using it, but
            due to limited stock and some moves being able to disrupt the execution is why
                <strong>Banjo and Kazooie</strong> aren't used as much as other <em>DLC
                characters.</em></p>
