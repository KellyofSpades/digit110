/TEI/text/body/div/count(div)
//list=>count() -> 3
//list[last()] -> sortKey="plants" and sortKey="art"
//list[position()] -> sortKey="animals", sortKey-"plants", and sortKey-"art"
//person/occupation[1] and (//person/occupation)[1] -> Are the parentheses finding th one spefific one that actually fits the cidentials rather than being a possibility? The only diiference i could notice was the instant="false" had quotes around it and one result rather than like a hundred
//person=>count() -> 1552, with @sex attribute count(//@sex) ->1393
I'm still very confused on all of this, but this looks a little better than the first one
