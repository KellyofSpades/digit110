1. //cbml:panel/@characters => distinct-values()
Duplicates are still there, mainly with "narrator", "green_man #anon_man_3", "green_man #anon_man_4", or any of the main character's names combined with others.

2. //cbml:panel/@characters ! tokenize(,'') and //cbml:panel/@characters ! tokenize(.,'\s') and //cbml:panel/@characters ! tokenize(@characters,' ')
Tokenize breaks up the combined characters on "distinct-values"

3. //cbml:panel/contains(characters, narrator)
FInds all thta contain the character attribute and "narrator", 56 were true

4. //cbml:balloon/string-length(@type)
Was about 6-7 for the types

5.//cbml:panel/note --> //cbml:panel[note[contains(., 'skull')]]
Corrected code to find skull
