        <Mario>Nice of the princess to invite us over for a picnic, <joke type="ytp">eh,
                Luigi?</joke></Mario>
        <Luigi>I hope she made lots of <joke type="ytp">spaghetti!</joke></Luigi>

            <letter from="Bowser">Dear pesky plumbers: The Koopalings and I have taken over the
                Mushroom Kingdom. The Princess is now a permanent guest at one of my seven Koopa
                hotels. I dare you to find her if you can.</letter> We've got to find the Princess. </Mario>
        <Luigi action="player">
            <joke type="ytp">And, you've</joke> got to help us.</Luigi>

    </sceneOne>

    <sceneTwo>
        <Mario>Looks kind of peaceful.</Mario>
        <Luigi action="player">Looks are deceiving when Koopas are involved.
            <!--Luigi just casually being racist--></Luigi>

    <sceneThree>
        <Mario>Uh-oh! Ow! Ooh. (Coughs.) <joke type="ytp">Where am I?</joke></Mario>
    </sceneThree>

    <sceneFour>
        <Mario>Hey, Princess!</Mario>
        <Peach> Oh!</Peach>
        <Luigi>How are we going to find the Princess with the power going out?</Luigi>
        <Mario action="player">Maybe there's a switch in one of the rooms. Remind me to
            check.</Mario>
    </sceneFour>

    <sceneFive>
        <Mario>Uh-huh. Here's the problem: too many toasters! <joke type="ytp">You know what they
                say, "All toasters toast toast!"</joke></Mario>
    </sceneFive>

    <sceneSix>
        <Mario>That ought to do it. </Mario>
        <Peach>Oh!</Peach>
        <Mario>Where'd she go? Gee, i---i---it's kind of dark.</Mario>
        <Luigi>You bring a light?</Luigi>
        <Mario><joke type="ytp">No.</joke></Mario>
        <Luigi>Well, maybe a Koopa will lend us his! If we *persuade* him.
            <!--First racism, and now threats? Damn Luigi this was 1994, not 1904--></Luigi>

    <sceneSeven>
        <Peach>Mario!</Peach>
        <Mario>Get ready to catch her.</Mario>
        <Luigi>She's not coming down!</Luigi>
        <Mario action="player">She's up there! It's hard to see through those clouds. I hope we can
            get rid of 'em. Get the hint?</Mario>
    </sceneSeven>

    <sceneEight>
        <Mario><joke type="ytp">Hey, you! Get off of my cloud! It's been one of those days.</joke>

        <Mario>Hurry!</Mario>
        <Mario>Spooky! <joke type="ytp">Where's the Princess?</joke></Mario>
        <Luigi><joke type="ytp">Over there!</joke> Look! Wendy's Hotel.</Luigi>
        <Mario>Be careful! When you pinch Wendy's pennies, <joke type="ytp">they pinch
            back.</joke></Mario>
    </sceneNine>

    <sceneTen>
        <Mario>That wasn't so hard. Was it?</Mario>
        <Peach>Boys!</Peach>
        <Bowser>(laughs)</Bowser>
        <Luigi>That's that creepy Bowser's laugh.</Luigi>
        <Mario>Look! This is it, Luigi. Remember, <joke type="ytp">where there's
