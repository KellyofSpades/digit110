    <lb len="45" n="9"/>Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,

    <lb len="43" n="11"/>Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
    <lb len="39" n="12"/>Within be fed, without be rich no more:
    <lb len="47" n="13"/>So shall thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
    <lb len="48" n="14"/>And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.
